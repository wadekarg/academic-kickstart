1.	Classification of points into two classes using single neuron - The training is done based on perceptron learning rule

2.	A Search Engine - The program returns the most similar document with the searched query

3.	Handwritten digits prediction from MNIST dataset - Achieved accurcy of 90% in predicting the digits using single layer neural network

4.	NBA Player position prediction - Achieved the accuracy of 73% to classify the NBA player(NBA Dataset) into 5 positions using K-Nearest Neighbor,
Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree

5.	Stock Price change prediction using Adaline and LMS algorithm - Implemented Widrow-Huff Learning rule to predict the price change in stock based on past data(real stock market data)

6.	Recommender System - Developed a recommendation engine for a movie dataset. The recommendation is provided using 3 methods, user based, item based, and content based

7.	Data classifier for multiple classes - Designed a multi-layer neural network to categorize the input data into multiple classes/clusters. Generated data
for multiple classes and trained the network it to classify them

8.	Image recognition using CNN - Achieved the accuracy of 78% to recognize images using a convolutional neural. The neural network is trained with the CIFAR-10 dataset which has 60000 images of 10 types of categories
